*\(Draft\)* click-project
==============================================================================

Click-project makes it *easy* and fun for ***you*** to create *awesome* command line interfaces!

Turn your scripts into a powerful cli without pain and get instant access to stuff like:

- great completion support
- persistence of options and arguments
- commands flow management
- launchers
- aliases
- and more...

click-project is a very *opinionated framework*, and is meant to be *batteries included*, meaning we gathered all the stuff we wanted while creating various commands. Dogfooding in mind, the developers are extensive users of click-project. They like it and when something feels wrong, they just change it.

# Why?

* This is very related to *argparse*. Why not just use *argparse*?

See [Click - why?](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/why/)

* This is very related to *click*. Why not just use *click*?

Click is very powerful when you need to create a command line tool. Yet, when we needed to create command line applications, we often wanted to reinvent the wheel by adding stuff like:

# What features?

Let's consider the example of a command line tool, say `clk`.

* great completion support, for the most used shells. Even if you use the command line, most likely you don't like typing that much, if you want to run `clk --someoption` are you barely think like us, you probably want to type `clk --s<TAB>`.
* persistence of options and arguments:
Say you want to run `clk --someoption` again and again and again. You'd like to record `--someoption` somewhere so that all the calls to `clk` will behave like `clk --someoption`.
* logging features: Having good logging capabilities is the basics of a suitable command line tool.
* powerful formatting helpers: The output of command line tools should be easy to read and easy to parse by an external tool. click-project provides some formatting features that can be easily configured from the command line to achieve this goal.
* directory based project: Say that you want to store
* argument documentation: arguments are at least as important as options, yet they don't have any documentation associated. click-project fixes that by allowing to add an help to the arguments.
* options groups: options can be grouped to structure the help of the commands.
* command flow management: TODO
* launchers: TODO
* alias: TODO

We decided to put all that in a single framework.

# Inspirations?

click-project is inspired by several other great command line tools. Just to name a few of them:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* [haskellstack](https://haskellstack.org)
* [Docker machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/)
* [Darcs](http://darcs.net)
* [vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)


# Installing

A classic : `python3 -m pip install click-project`

# Getting started

When you install `click-project`, a command line tool called `clk` is installed also. You may want to play a little bit with it to get the look and feel.

First, run `clk --help` or more simply `clk`.

...

## Let's get your hands dirty: Adding your own command

Let's start with the classical hello world example.

If you are here, you might already know click. Let's use its hello example as a start.

Say you want to add a command to `clk`. `clk` is configured to import all the modules of the `clk_commands_perso` package. So start by creating this package and make it available.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/python/clk_commands_perso
export PYTHONPATH=~/python/:${PYTHONPATH}
```

Then, create the `hello.py` file under `~/python/clk_commands_perso/` with the following content:

```python
# hello.py
import click
from click_project.decorators import command, option

@command()
@option("--count", default=1, help="Number of greetings.")
@option("--name", prompt="Your name", help="The person to greet.")
def hello(count, name):
    """Simple program that greets NAME for a total of COUNT times."""
    for _ in range(count):
        click.echo(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Now, you should be able to run `clk hello`! Also, have a look at `clk hello --help`.

### Where is the *completion*?

First, you need to install it. For example in a bash shell, you can type:
```bash
clk completion install
source ~/.bash_completion
```

Now, try something like `clk hell<TAB> --co<TAB> 5`.

### Where is the *option persistence*?

You know your name, right?

Try `clk hello --set-paramaters global --name Toto`. Here `global` is the persistence level, we will detail later. The rest should be explicit enough. (?)

Now, run:
```bash
$ clk hello
Hello, Toto!
```

But don't worry if you want to say hi to someone else you can still type:
```bash
$ clk hello --name Baba
Hello, baba!
```

Also, have a look at `clk parameters`, or `clk parameters show --legend`.
Hey, why doesn't the legend always appear? It's for you to decide, but there it is:
`clk parameters show --set-parameters global --legend`

### What is this *command flow management*?

Say you made other commands `whatsup.py` and `bye.py`:

```python
# whatsup.py
import click
from click_project.decorators import command

@command()
def whatsup():
    """Simple program that says bye."""
    click.echo("What's up?!")
    click.echo("Awesome!")
```

```python
# bye.py
import click
from click_project.decorators import command

@command()
def bye():
    """Simple program that says bye."""
    click.echo("Bye!")
```

You might want to *chain* them and often do something like `clk hello && clk whatsup && clk bye`.

Well, you can define precedence links of your commands like this:
```
clk flowdeps set whatsup hello
clk flowdeps set bye whatsup
```
Then, try: `clk bye --flow` ! :)
The output should look something like:
```
Running step 'hello'
Hello, Toto!
Running step 'whatsup'
What's up?!
Awesome!
Bye!
```
Bonus: `clk flowdeps graph mycommand` let's you see the dependency graph for `mycommand` in a nice visual way!

Want more? Have a look at `clk flowdeps --help`!

## logging

Logging should be easy to read yet provide enough information for debugging for example. Moreover, the logging should be well separated from other outputs from the command line tool. In click project, we have created several logging levels that allows to easily change the log level required for a specific use case, and the logs are displayed with colors and on the error output by default.
